# Neural Networks for Recognition
 Using hand-coded (python) and PyTorch-based Neural Networks (and auto-encoders) for recognition of flowers, digits and alphabets.

The Problem Statement is from a course -> (16-720B) Computer Vision. Results were achieved under the guidance of Prof. Deva Kannan Ramanan and his Teaching Assistants.

The zip folder has the important parts of the assignment, including all the theory and the code. Please do not plagiarize if you're taking the course as well!!! Feel free to reach out to me for anything regarding this.
